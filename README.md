# firstUniqueCharacter

This is an example of a simple program that takes any text as input and finds the first character in each word of the text that is no longer repeated within the word being analyzed.

From the obtained set of characters, the program should then select the first unique character (i.e., the one that no longer appears in the set) and return it.
